<ul>
<li>Download the most recent IMAGER from http://download.iiab.io/packages/imager/. Depending on the speed of your internet, this could take a while (about 112MB).</li>
<li>Use https://etcher.io or https://sourceforge.net/projects/win32diskimager/ to write the downloaded image file to a USB stick (all data will be lost)</li>
<li>Make sure that your BIOS is set to boot first from USB -- setting the BIOS may require that you strike the F1, F2, F10, F12, or Delete key just after turning on the power.</li>
<li>Look for a BIOS setting called &quot;boot options&quot; or &quot;boot order&quot;, and make sure that USB disk comes first.</li>
<li>Put the USB stick into the machine, and turn on the power.</li>
<li>After a short time you should see the colorful boot process of Tiny Core Linux, and eventually the IMAGER menu as shown at https://github.com/iiab/iiab-factory/blob/master/box/rpi/imager/docs/README.md</li>
