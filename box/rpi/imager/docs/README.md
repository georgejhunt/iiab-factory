## How to Get Started -- Create Imager on USB 
* Download the most recent IMAGER from http://download.iiab.io/packages/imager/.
* On Windows, right click on the downloaded < filename >.img.zip file, and select "extract all files".
* On Windows, use https://etcher.io/ or https://sourceforge.net/projects/win32diskimager/ to write the downloaded image file to a USB stick (all data will be lost).

### Boot IMAGER on your Windows machine
* Make sure that your BIOS is set to boot first from USB -- setting the BIOS may require that you strike the f1, f2, f10, f12, or del key just after turning on the power.
* Look for a BIOS setting called "boot options" or "boot order".
* Put the USB stick into the machine, and turn on the power.
* After a short time you should see the IMAGER menu as shown at https://github.com/iiab/iiab-factory/box/rpi/imager/docs/USAGE.md.
