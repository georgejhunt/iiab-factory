## How to Get Started -- Create IMAGER on a USB Stick
* Download the most recent IMAGER from http://download.iiab.io/packages/imager/. Depending on the speed of your internet, this could take a while (about 112MB).
* Use https://etcher.io or https://sourceforge.net/projects/win32diskimager/ to write the downloaded image file to a USB stick (all data will be lost)
* Make sure that your BIOS is set to boot first from USB -- setting the BIOS may require that you strike the F1, F2, F10, F12, or Delete key just after turning on the power.
* Look for a BIOS setting called "boot options" or "boot order", and make sure that USB disk comes first.
* Put the USB stick into the machine, and turn on the power.
* After a short time you should see the colorful boot process of Tiny Core Linux, and eventually the IMAGER menu as shown at https://github.com/iiab/iiab-factory/blob/master/box/rpi/imager/docs/README.md
